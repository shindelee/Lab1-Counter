Test Yourself Challenges: 
(1) Modify the testbench so that you stop counting for 3 cycles once the counter reaches 0x9, and then resume counting. You may also need to change the stimulus for rst.

(2) The current counter has a synchronous reset. To implement asynchronous reset, you can change line 11 of counter.sv to detect change in rst signal.

Make these modification, compile and run. Examine the waveform with GTKwave and explain what you see.
